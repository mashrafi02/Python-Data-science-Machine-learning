There are basically 3 steps to hadle missing or null values -->

1. Simply delete the record which has missing value
	When you have a huge dataset consists of milllions of data and some of the rows have many null values in 
	manuu columns , then you can consider this method.

2. Create a seperate model to handle the missing or null values --> very complex method
	whenever you have a smaller dataset, you can consider applying this method. Here you can make a seperate dataset which 
	will have the missing value column as a target feature and others along with the target feature of the original dataset as 
	feature data. Then you will create your model based on this new dataset and predict the missing value and fill it in the original dataset.
	You may create more than one new seperate dataset based on your missing values quantity in each column of your original dataset and predict 
	missing values for each seperate dataset. From the above info  you can see that process is more time consumable and computational effort is also 
	very high. So, consider this method only when you have a smaller and simple dataset. Other wise avoid it.

3. Using stastical methods like mean, median or mode --> The best method
	Here you will use some statastical methods like -->>>
	Average (mean) -- fill the missing values with the average of that column
	Median  -- fill the missing values with the center value of that column after sorting the column's value in ascending format
	Mode --  fill the missing values with the most appering value of that column means the value with the most frequency
