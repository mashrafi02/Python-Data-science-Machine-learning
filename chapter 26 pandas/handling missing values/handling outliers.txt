There are 2 methods of identifyi ng outliers -->

1. Z-score ((Observation(X) - mean(mew)) / STD) 
	-->> if the z-score is falling under 3 or 3rd STD then it won't be a outlier

2. IQR (Inter Quantile Range(75% percentile number - 25% percentile number))
	-->> lower bound value(lbv) = 25% percentile - IQR*1.5
	     upper bound value (ubv)= 75% percentile + IQR*1.5

	     anything lesser than lbv or greater than ubv will be called an outlier

3. Scatter plot
4. Box plot
